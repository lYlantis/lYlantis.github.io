				In 2011 I wrecked my old car, a 1993 Nissan Altima.  Being the super cheap guy that I am it took me a long time to buy something else.   Before my wreck I was not too concerned about the way that I drove my car and did not think about the effects of my driving on my MPG and my wallet.  
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Going in to purchase this next car I had really become conscious of costs added up over time.  I also did my research this time.  The car's price and fuel efficiency were my priorities. I had two demands for this car.  It had to be right around $10,000 so I could pay cash for it and it had to get at least 40 MPG on the highway.  I do a lot of highway driving and was really hoping to bring my costs down. After looking in to it for an inordinate amount of time I had narrowed it down to a list of a few cars.  Chief among them was the Jetta TDI.  It took me forever, but I finally found one close by and bought it.

				Here are a few articles on diesel efficiency if you are interested in further study:

				</ul>

				I have recorded every mile that I have driven and the cost since I have purchased the car. The full file can be downloaded at the bottom of this page.

				Here are the totals to 11/20/14:

				I know that I have been saving money on fuel since I bought this car so I did some calculations to add it all up to see what it had been like if I hadn't been forced to buy a new car. The government says that my Altima got 21 city, 27 hwy, and 23 combined mpg <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymake/Nissan1993.shtml">(Fuel Economy.gov)</a>. Fuel prices taken from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/">eia.gov</a>. Here are the totals:

				This gives us a total of $826.20 savings per year. Here is my MPG change over time:
