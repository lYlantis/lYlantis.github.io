				I got my first credit card ever with the intent of abusing the US mints presidential dollar direct ship program. You can read about it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fatwallet.com/forums/finance/837472/">Here</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Shortly after I got my card the mint caught on and canceled the program. This was disappointing, but sparked an idea for doing this with other things.
			I began charging everyone's purchases on my card for exact cash and running everything off of my card. Including business and personal use, this has added up to substantial rewards. It also has the added benefit of boosting my credit score.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I currently have three cards that I use regularly:
			
				<ul>
					<li>My main card is my Capital One Venture - 2% cash back on everything $59 annual fee that they will waive if you call.</li>
					<li>I also use the discover more card - 1% cash back on everything and 5% on a specific thing every 3 months. $0 annual fee</li>
					<li>The last card that I use regularly is my Bank of America Cash Rewards Platinum - 3% cash back on gas </li>
				</ul>
				
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Here is a graph showing the amounts I've charged on each of the main cards in the last year. I just started using the BOA card

			<img src="2013-2014 Charges.png" alt="Something Went Wrong!" style="width:40%">
			
			<p>
				As you can see, I have made quite a bit in the past two years for simply changing the way that I pay for things. It does not take me any additional time and I have never been charged a fee other than the $59 membership fee. This also does not take into account all of the cards and bank accounts that I have opened just to get the bonus.
			</p>

			<p>
				This starts to really add up if we take it out over the remainder of my life. I have on average, about 55 years left of life. If I keep my current level of charging at $80,000 until I die that will mean I have spent about $4,400,000 in those 55 years. At 2% return on my spending, that will be an additional minimum of $88,000 that I will get for no additional time investment.
